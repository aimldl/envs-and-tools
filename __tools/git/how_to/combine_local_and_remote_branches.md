# How to Combine Local and Remote Branches
- Created: 2024-12-11 (Wed)

## Problem
On my local machine, `git push` and `git pull` failed due to divergent branches.

### `git push`
```bash
$ git push
```
```bash
Username for 'https://github.com': aimldl
Password for 'https://aimldl@github.com': 
To https://github.com/aimldl/vertex-ai.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/aimldl/vertex-ai.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
$
```

As the message says
```bash
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
```
fetch first
```bash
$ git pull
```
```bash
remote: Enumerating objects: 8, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (8/8), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.

hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint: 
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint: 
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.
$
```

You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before your next pull:

```bash
  git config pull.rebase false  # merge
  git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
  git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
```

```bash

```
```bash

```
```bash

```
```bash

```

## Hint
Specify how to combine the changes in both branches.

## Gemini Advanced
TODO: Read the following part and run commands to merge them.
```
Understanding the Options

Merge (git config pull.rebase false): This creates a new "merge commit" that combines the changes from both branches. It preserves the complete history of both branches, which can be helpful for tracking changes but can also lead to a more complex commit history.
Rebase (git config pull.rebase true): This reapplies your local commits on top of the latest remote changes. It results in a cleaner, linear history, but it rewrites history, which can be problematic if you've already shared your local commits with others.
Fast-forward only (git config pull.ff only): This only updates your local branch if it can be done without creating a merge commit. If not, it will throw an error. This keeps the history clean but might force you to merge manually more often.
Choosing the Best Option

If you haven't shared your local commits with others and want a clean history: Use rebase (git config pull.rebase true).
If you have shared your local commits or want to preserve the complete history: Use merge (git config pull.rebase false).
If you want to avoid merge commits whenever possible: Use fast-forward only (git config pull.ff only).
How to Proceed

Choose your preferred option based on the above considerations.
Set the option either for this specific repository or globally:
For this repository: git config pull.rebase true (replace true with false or only as needed)
Globally: git config --global pull.rebase true
Run git pull again.
Example:

If you want to use rebase for this repository, run:

Bash

git config pull.rebase true
git pull
This will reapply your local commits on top of the latest remote changes.

Remember to choose the option that best suits your workflow and the specific situation. If you're unsure, it's usually safer to start with merge to avoid rewriting history.
